Their are many choices you### EditorsThere are many editors to choose from for editor your Ruby on Rails application code. Editors are fairly simple. They allow editing files without too much bloat. This book will use [SublimeText](http://sublimetext.com), cost of $70 to use continuly, as the editor. There are number of others out there. If you are on Mac I would suggest that you use [TextMate](http://macromates.com) as your editor. The current version of TextMate, version 1, costs $39. However [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/texmate/), the next release that is currently in beta. [TextmMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/texmate/) is free.### Integrated Development EnvironmentIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) have a large amount of tools included. These tools help highlight errors in code, run tests, run your development server and other tools that can help you when you are developing your code. These are normally paid for software. I haven't used very many IDE's can't make any remarks on them.
