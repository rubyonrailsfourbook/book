## Your Personal Development Environment
There are several options when it comes to creating a development the suites your tastes. Their are many choices you that you can make. You could use a plain editor or you could use an integrated development environment, IDE.That has many tools and a graphical interface, GUI.

### Editors
There are many editors to choose from for editor your Ruby on Rails application code. Editors are fairly simple. They allow editing files without too much bloat. This book will use [SublimeText](http://sublimetext.com), cost of $70 to use continually, as the editor. There are number of others out there. If you are on Mac I would suggest that you use [TextMate](http://macromates.com) as your editor. The current version of TextMate, version 1, costs $39. However [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/texmate/), the next release that is currently in beta. TextMate 2 is free and open source. Another popular editor within the Rails community is [vim](http://www.vim.org/). Many people enjoy vim. Specially people with prior UNIX experince. However for beginners I don't recommend vim as a starting editor 

### Integrated Development Environment
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have a large amount of tools included. These tools help highlight errors in code, run tests, run your development server and other tools that can help you when you are developing your code. These are normally paid for software. I haven't used very many IDE's can't make any remarks on them.
