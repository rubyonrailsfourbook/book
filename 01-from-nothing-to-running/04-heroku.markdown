## Deploying to Heroku

### Limitions

#### Can't Write to Disk
You can't write to the disk of your box that hosts your site. If you want uploads you need something like [Amzaon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).


### Strengths

#### Every to Expand
Tons of addons to many needs. This includes MySQL, New Relic, SSL, and lots more.

#### Scales Very Well 
A part of creating a web app is scaling. Heroku makes scaling is very easy. All one has to do move a slider up to increase capacity when needed. Then when the amount of requests are lower the slider can brought back down.
