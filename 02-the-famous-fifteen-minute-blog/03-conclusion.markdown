## ConclusionThere are few issues with this platform. The first issue would we security. The way this blog is setup any user could create and edit any post just by knowing URL to these actions. This is very dangerous and could set you up for a very long and hard legal battle if someone posts something illegal. The second is that lack of delayed publishing. If want to release a post a midnight you will have to post then. Also, there is no organization. All the posts a put into one stream. There are no tags to organization the content so that people can find what they are looking for. Fourthly there is no comment threads. Comments threads are nice in that give the comments some conversational sense.
