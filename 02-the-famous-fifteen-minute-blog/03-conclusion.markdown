## Conclusion
There are few isssues with this platform. The first issue would we security. The way this blog is setup any user could create post just by knowing url to. This is very dangous and could set you up for a very long and hard legal battle if someone posts something bad. The second is that lack of delayed pubishing. If want to release a post a midnight you will have to post then. Also there is no oranzation is this blog. All the posts a put into one stream. There are no tags to orangize the content so that poeple can find what they are looking for.
