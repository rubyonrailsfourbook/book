## Sign Up Success

### Email Confirm, A Case Intentional Lazyness
When signing up for a new service the user enters all of there infomation to create there and then a message appears: 

> Please check your inbox for email to active your account. You can't use your account until you do so.

This is depressing for the user. The user has to sit around a wait for an email. The email might not show in there inbox and they have to check there spam. This can take over five mintutes to do. While every second for customer loses interest in the product they sigend up for. This is an easy to lose potential *paying* customers.
