## Asset Pipeline
The asset pipeline is a feature of rails that helps you make your JavaScript, stylesheets, images, and any other assets work better for you. Assets be stored in three places.
- `app/assets`
- `lib/assets`
- `vendor/assets`

The reason for the asset pipeline is to make JavaScript code among other things a first class citizen. The asset pipeline also allows for writing your asset code in scss and coffescript with ease.
